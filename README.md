## 🧠 How It Works

The **BMI (Body Mass Index)** is a value derived from an individual's height and weight, used to categorize health status.

### 🧪 Calculation Formula

Since the user inputs height in **centimeters**, it is first converted to **meters** during the calculation. The JavaScript logic looks like this:

```javascript
let bmi = (weight / ((height * height) / 10000)).toFixed(2);
```
